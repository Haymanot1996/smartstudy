## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for students.
- **Dashboard**: A central hub displaying an overview of tasks, schedules, and important notifications.
- **Schedule Management**: Tools to organize classes, study sessions, and extracurricular activities.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices with a modern UI/UX.
- **Data Management**: Efficient handling of user data using a robust backend system.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout (likely including custom styles or a framework).
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features and dynamic content rendering.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for handling API routes and middleware.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: (via Mongoose) For storing user data and application records.
